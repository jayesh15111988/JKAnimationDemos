#JKAnimationDemos
**This repository is based on the animation examples from 'iOS Core Animation: Advanced Techniques' by Nick Lockwood**

> First off, thanks to Nick Lockwood for such a wonderful and simple book 'iOS Core Animation: Advanced Techniques'. It helped me to realize how much information I was missing as an iOS developer. Almost all examples are inspired from this book. Obviously, I have made few changes before making this demo but nevertheless it was not possible without it at all.

_Note : Though it will be too time consuming to go through all the demos (At least 15 categories), I will try to summarize only few which I perceive to be important ones_

-  **Loading View** - Say you have to load some heavy resource such as image or a video from an internet. This animation could present this information in more pleasing manner to the user

- **Animating image** - This demo deals with sprite images which are used to create the animation given that sprite is long enough to show multiple changing images in one go

- **Bezier path demo** - Shows how funny drawing could be created using Bezier paths provided by an iOS core animation

- **3D cube Demo** - A simple demonstration of rotation and translation of cubic shape. I made it while playing with 3D transformations and trying to understand how exactly does that work. User interactive properties could be changed on fly.

- **Replication Layer** - Another gem from Core graphics. Shows how reflection could be mimicked by using simple replication layer feature

- **Bezier animation** - Shows bezier curve animation. Timing functions are converted to bezier path and path conversions are animated accordingly

- **More Bezier curve fun** - Making drawing using bezier curves. Add ability to make custom strokes on the canvas

There are only some of few I have added for now. Project features more demos than listed here. Let me know if you have suggestions/ comments/ critics on the project. I will be more than happy to incorporate them in the project.
